== Spring Cloud Release Tools

Spring Cloud projects reuse the same pattern of building and deploying the applications. That's
why this tool makes it easy to automate the release / dependency update process of our applications.

=== What does it do?

==== Single project

For a single project

- Clones the Spring Cloud Release project and picks all versions (Boot + Cloud projects)
- Modifies the project versions with values from SC-Release
  * throws an exception when we bump versions to release and there's a SNAPSHOT version referenced in the POM
- Performs the build and checks if the `docs` modules have properly created the documentation
  * throws an exception when in the `docs` module there's an unresolved tag in any HTML file
- Commits changed poms (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Creates a tag for the release / milestone (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Runs the deployment of the artifacts
- Publishes the docs (to `spring-cloud-static` for non-snapshots, to `gh-pages` for snapshots)
- Reverts back to snapshots, bumps the version by a patch (`1.0.1.RELEASE` -> `1.0.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`) (ONLY FOR RELEASE VERSIONS)
- Closes the milestone on Github (e.g. `v1.0.1.RELEASE`) (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)

IMPORTANT: Starting with version that does Sagan integration, you MUST pass the OAuth token,
otherwise the application will fail to start

After project release

- Generates an email template under `target/email.txt` (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Generates a blog template under `target/blog.md` (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Generates a tweet template under `target/tweet.txt` (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Generates a release notes template under `target/notes.md` (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Updates project information in Sagan (http://spring.io) (ONLY FOR SNAPSHOT / RELEASE VERSIONS)
- For `GA`/ `SR` release will create an issue in Spring Guides under https://github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-guides/issues/
- For `GA`/ `SR` release will update the links under https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-static/tree/gh-pages/current

==== Meta-release

- Uses the fixed versions to clone and check out each project (e.g. `spring-cloud-sleuth: 2.1.0.RELEASE`)
- From the version analyzes the branch and checks it out. E.g.
** for `spring-cloud-release`'s `Finchley.RELEASE` version will resolve either `Finchley.x` branch or will fallback to `master` if there's no `Finchley.x` branch.
** for `spring-cloud-sleuth`'s `2.1.0.RELEASE` version will resolve `2.1.x` branch
- Performs the release tasks per each project
- Performs the post release tasks at the end of the release

IMPORTANT: For the meta-releaser to work we assume that the path to the
custom configuration file for each project is always `config/releaser.yml`.

=== What should I do first?

Members of the Spring Cloud Team typically use this tool as follows. They first
clone the releaser locally and build the jar manually

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:spring-cloud/spring-cloud-release-tools.git
$ cd spring-cloud-release-tools
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

IMPORTANT: You must set the value of the OAuth token. You can do it either via
the command line `--releaser.git.oauth-token=...` or put it as an env variable in `.bashrc`
or `.zshrc` e.g. `export RELEASER_GIT_OAUTH_TOKEN=...`

=== How to run it (interactive mode)

Go to your project (e.g. Spring Cloud Sleuth)

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth.git
$ cd spring-cloud-sleuth
$ # example of running the releaser agains Dalston.SR1 tag with 1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT version of the releaser
$ java -jar ~/repo/spring-cloud-release-tools/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --releaser.pom.branch=vDalston.SR1 --spring.config.name=releaser
----

The application will start running from your working directory. Running this code
follows the convention that you have the OAuth token environment variable set. It also assumes
that you might have some custom configuration in `config/releaser.yml` file. This setting is optional - if
you don't have that file, nothing will happen.

TIP:  It is important that you clone the repository you are going to release using SSH in order for the
`releaser` to be able to push tags and commit changes automatically.

You will see text similar to this one

[source]
----
=== WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? ===

0) Perform a full release of this project without interruptions
1) Perform a full release of this project in a verbose mode (you'll be asked about skipping steps)
2) Update poms with versions from Spring Cloud Release
3) Build the project
4) Commit, tag and push the tag
5) Deploy the artifacts
6) Publish the docs
7) Go back to snapshots and bump originalVersion by patch
8) Push the commits
9) Close the milestone at Github
10) Create email / blog / tweet etc. templates

You can pick a range of options by using the hyphen - e.g. '2-4' will execute jobs [2,3,4]
You can execute all tasks starting from a job by using a hyphen and providing only one number - e.g. '8-' will execute jobs [8,9,10]
You can execute given tasks by providing a comma separated list of tasks - e.g. '3,7,8' will execute jobs [3,7,8]

You can press 'q' to quit
----

Just pick a number and continue! Pick either a full release or single steps. You can also pick
ranges or multiple steps. You can also provide the range only with the starting step
- that you will execute all steps starting from the given one.

TIP: Read before picking a number cause it might have changed between tool releases ;)

=== How to run it (automatic mode)

Go to your project (e.g. Spring Cloud Sleuth) and execute the application with `-h` or `--help`
flag.

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth.git
$ cd spring-cloud-sleuth
$ # example of running the releaser agains Dalston.SR1 tag with 1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT version of the releaser
$ java -jar ~/repo/spring-cloud-release-tools/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --releaser.pom.branch=vDalston.SR1 --spring.config.name=releaser -h
----

You will see a help screen looking like more or less like this

[source,bash]
----
Here you can find the list of tasks in order

[updatePoms,build,commit,deploy,docs,snapshots,push,closeMilestone,createTemplates,updateSagan,updateGuides,updateDocumentation]


Option                                Description
------                                -----------
-a, --start-from <String>             Starts all release task starting from the
                                        given task. Requires passing the task
                                        name (either one letter or the full
                                        name)
-b, --build [String]                  Build the project
-c, --commit [String]                 Commit, tag and push the tag
-d, --deploy [String]                 Deploy the artifacts
-f, --full-release [Boolean]          Do you want to do the full release
                                        (default: false)
-g, --updateSagan [String]            Updating Sagan with release info
-h, --help [String]
-i, --interactive <Boolean>           Do you want to set the properties from
                                        the command line (default: true)
-m, --closeMilestone [String]         Close the milestone at Github
-o, --docs [String]                   Publish the docs
-p, --push [String]                   Push the commits
-r, --range <String>                  Runs release tasks from the given range.
                                        Requires passing the task names with a
                                        hyphen. The first task is inclusive,
                                        the second inclusive. E.g. 's-m' would
                                        mean running 'snapshot', 'push' and
                                        'milestone' tasks
-s, --snapshots [String]              Go back to snapshots and bump
                                        originalVersion by patch
-t, --createTemplates [String]        Create email / blog / tweet etc. templates
-u, --updatePoms [String]             Update poms with versions from Spring
                                        Cloud Release
--ud, --updateDocumentation [String]  Updating documentation repository
--ug, --updateGuides [String]         Updating Spring Guides

Examples of usage:

Run 'build' & 'commit' & 'deploy'
java -jar jar.jar -b -c -d

Start from 'push'
java -jar releaser.jar -a push

Range 'docs' -> 'push'
java -jar releaser.jar -r o-p
----

The Releaser can use two sets of options. The configuration options like `releaser.pom.branch`
and the task switches. For the tasks you can use either the full names or short switches. For example
 providing range of tasks via switches `o-p` is equivalent to full name `docs-push`.

A couple of examples:

=== How to run meta-release (automatic-mode)

All you have to do is run the jar with the releaser and pass the
`-x=true` option to turn on meta-release and a list of fixed versions
in the `--"releaser.fixed-versions[project-name]=project-version" format

```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=releaser -x=true --"releaser.fixed-versions[spring-cloud-sleuth]=2.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"
```

IMPORTANT: For the meta release the `startFrom` or `taskNames` take into consideration
the project names, not task names. E.g. you can start from `spring-cloud-netflix` project,
or build only tasks with names `spring-cloud-build,spring-cloud-sleuth`.

=== Project options

- `releaser.fixed-versions` - A String to String mapping of manually set versions. E.g. `"spring-cloud-cli" -> "1.0.0.RELEASE"` will set
the `spring-cloud-cli.version` to `1.0.0.RELEASE` regardless of what was set in `spring-cloud-release` project. Example `--releaser.fixed-versions[spring-cloud-cli]=1.0.0.RELEASE`.
Use these properties to provide versions for the meta release.

- `releaser.meta-release.enabled` - You have to turn it on to enable a meta release. Defaults to `false`
- `releaser.meta-release.release-train-project-name` - Name of the project that represents the BOM of the release train. Defaults to `spring-cloud-release`
- `releaser.meta-release.git-org-url` - The URL of the Git organization. We'll append each project's name to it.
Defaults to `https://github.com/spring-cloud`

- `releaser.git.fetch-versions-from-git` - If `true` then should fill the map of versions from Git. If `false` then picks fixed versions
- `releaser.git.clone-destination-dir` - Where should the Spring Cloud Release repo get cloned to. If null defaults to a temporary directory
- `releaser.git.spring-cloud-release-git-url` - URL to Spring Cloud Release Git repository. Defaults to `https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-release`
- `releaser.git.documentation-url` - URL to the documentation Git repository. Defaults to `https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-static`
- `releaser.git.documentation-branch` - Branch to check out for the documentation project. Defaults to `gh-pages`
- `releaser.git.oauth-token` - GitHub OAuth token to be used to interact with GitHub repo.
- `releaser.git.username` - Optional Git username. If not passed keys will be used for authentication.
- `releaser.git.password` - Optional Git password. If not passed keys will be used for authentication.
- `releaser.git.number-of-checked-milestones` - In order not to iterate endlessly over milestones we introduce a threshold of milestones that
we will go through to find the matching milestone. Defaults to `10`
- `releaser.maven.build-command` - Command to be executed to build the project. Defaults to `./mvnw clean install -Pdocs`
- `releaser.maven.deploy-command` - Command to be executed to deploy a built project". Defaults to `./mvnw deploy -DskipTests -Pfast`
- `releaser.maven.publish-docs-commands` - Command to be executed to deploy a built project. If present `{{version}}` will be replaced by the proper version.
Defaults to the standard Spring Cloud wget and execution of ghpages.
- `releaser.maven.system-properties` - Additional system properties that should be passed to any commands. If present `{{systemProps}}` will be replaced by the contents of this property.
- `releaser.maven.wait-time-in-minutes` - Max wait time in minutes for the process to finish. Defaults to `20`
- `releaser.gradle.gradle-props-substitution` - a map containing a `key` which is a property key inside `gradle.properties` and a `value` of
a project name. E.g. in `gradle.properties` you have `foo=1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` and you would like `spring-cloud-contract` version to
be set there. Just provide a mapping for the `gradle-props-substition` looking like this `foo=spring-cloud-contract` and the result
(e.g for sc-contract version `2.0.0.RELEASE`) will be an updated `gradle.properties` with entry `foo=2.0.0.RELEASE`
- `releaser.pom.branch` - Which branch of Spring Cloud Release should be checked out. Defaults to "master",
- `releaser.pom.ignored-pom-regex` - List of regular expressions of ignored poms. Defaults to test projects and samples.
Example: `"--releaser.pom.ignored-pom-regex=".{asterisk}\\.git/.{asterisk}$,.\{asterisk}spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/src/test/projects/.{asterisk}$,.{asterisk}spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/target/.{asterisk}$,.{asterisk}samples/standalone/[a-z]+/.{asterisk}$"`
- `releaser.working-dir` - By default Releaser assumes running the program from the current working directory.

TIP: You can pass the options either via system properties or via application arguments.
Example for system properties: `java -Dreleaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6 -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar`
Example for application arguments: `java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6`

IMPORTANT: For the GA release to be successful, it's important that if the `build` / `deploy` command
 run a script (e.g. `scripts/foo.sh`) then inside `foo.sh` if you call a Maven build `./mvnw clean install`
 then *remember to pass all arguments of the script there too*. E.g. `./mvnw clean install ${@}`. That's because
 the releaser will pass any system properties to the `build` / `deploy` command, such as system properties
 with keys and we need them to be passed inside the command executed by the releaser.


=== Examples

==== Keeping configuration in the project

If your project has some custom configuration (e.g. Spring Cloud Contract needs a script to be executed
to build the project and properly merge the docs) then you can put a file named e.g. `releaser.yml` under `config`
folder and run your application like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/cloud/internal/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar -O ../spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --spring.config.name=releaser
----

TIP: Notice that we're downloading the jar to a parent folder, not to `target`. That's because `target` get cleaned
during the build process

IMPORTANT: For the meta-releaser to work we assume that the path to the
configuration file is always `config/releaser.yml`.

==== Specifying A Branch

By deafult the releaser will default to using the `master` branch of `spring-cloud-release`.
If you would like to use another branch you can specify it using the `releaser.pom.branch` property.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6
----

==== Using Environment Variables

In some cases it might be easier to specify environment variables instead of passing parameters to
`releaser`.  For example, you might want to use environment variables if you are going to be
releasing multiple projects, this keeps you from having to specify the same parameters for
each release

[source,bash]
----
$ export RELEASER_POM_BRANCH=Dalston.RELEASE
$ export RELEASER_GIT_OAUTH_TOKEN=...
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/cloud/internal/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar -O spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.working-dir=/path/to/project/root
----

== Building

:jdkversion: 1.7

=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install JDK {jdkversion}.

Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ ./mvnw install
----

NOTE: You can also install Maven (>=3.3.3) yourself and run the `mvn` command
in place of `./mvnw` in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add `-P spring` if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.

NOTE: Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with
a value like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We try to cover this in
the `.mvn` configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.

For hints on how to build the project look in `.travis.yml` if there
is one. There should be a "script" and maybe "install" command. Also
look at the "services" section to see if any services need to be
running locally (e.g. mongo or rabbit).  Ignore the git-related bits
that you might find in "before_install" since they're related to setting git
credentials and you already have those.

The projects that require middleware generally include a
`docker-compose.yml`, so consider using
http://compose.docker.io/[Docker Compose] to run the middeware servers
in Docker containers. See the README in the
https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts[scripts demo
repository] for specific instructions about the common cases of mongo,
rabbit and redis.

NOTE: If all else fails, build with the command from `.travis.yml` (usually
`./mvnw install`).

=== Documentation

The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
http://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue as long as they use Maven 3.3.3 or better.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

NOTE: Older versions of m2e do not support Maven 3.3, so once the
projects are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell
m2eclipse to use the right profile for the projects.  If you
see many different errors related to the POMs in the projects, check
that you have an up to date installation.  If you can't upgrade m2e,
add the "spring" profile to your `settings.xml`. Alternatively you can
copy the repository settings from the "spring" profile of the parent
pom into your `settings.xml`.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.


IMPORTANT: There are 2 different versions of language level used in Spring Cloud Sleuth. Java 1.7 is used for main sources and
Java 1.8 is used for tests. When importing your project to an IDE please activate the `ide` Maven profile to turn on
Java 1.8 for both main and test sources. Of course remember that you MUST NOT use Java 1.8 features in the main sources. If you do
so your app will break during the Maven build.

== Contributing

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/code-of-conduct.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).

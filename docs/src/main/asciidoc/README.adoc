== Building

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/building.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: There are 2 different versions of language level used in Spring Cloud Sleuth.
Java 1.7 is used for main sources and Java 1.8 is used for tests.
When importing your project to an IDE please activate the `ide` Maven profile to turn on Java 1.8 for both main and test sources.
Of course remember that you MUST NOT use Java 1.8 features in the main sources.
If you do so your app will break during the Maven build.

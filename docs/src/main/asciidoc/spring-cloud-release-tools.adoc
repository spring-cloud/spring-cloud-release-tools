== Spring Cloud Release Tools

Spring Cloud projects reuse the same pattern of building and deploying the applications. That's
why this tool makes it easy to automate the release / dependency update process of our applications.

=== What does it do?

- Clones the Spring Cloud Release project and picks all versions (Boot + Cloud projects)
- Modifies the project versions with values from SC-Release
  * throws an exception when we bump versions to release and there's a SNAPSHOT version referenced in the POM
- Performs the build and checks if the `docs` modules have properly created the documentation
  * throws an exception when in the `docs` module there's an unresolved tag in any HTML file
- Commits changed poms (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Creates a tag for the release / milestone (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)
- Runs the deployment of the artifacts
- Publishes the docs (to `spring-cloud-static` for non-snapshots, to `gh-pages` for snapshots)
- Reverts back to snapshots, bumps the version by a patch (`1.0.1.RELEASE` -> `1.0.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`) (ONLY FOR RELEASE VERSIONS)
- Closes the milestone on Github (e.g. `v1.0.1.RELEASE`) (ONLY FOR NON-SNAPSHOT VERSIONS)

=== How to run it

Currently we only support running the Releaser to update the poms from Java

Go to your project (e.g. Spring Cloud Sleuth)

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth
$ cd spring-cloud-sleuth
$ mkdir -p target
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/cloud/internal/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar -O target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
----

The application will start running from your working directory.

=== Project options

- `releaser.git.clone-destination-dir` - Where should the Spring Cloud Release repo get cloned to. If null defaults to a temporary directory
- `releaser.git.spring-cloud-release-git-url` - URL to Spring Cloud Release Git repository. Defaults to `https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-release`
- `releaser.git.oauth-token` - GitHub OAuth token to be used to interact with GitHub repo.
- `releaser.maven.build-command` - Command to be executed to build the project. Defaults to `./mvnw clean install -Pdocs`
- `releaser.maven.deploy-command` - Command to be executed to deploy a built project". Defaults to `./mvnw deploy -DskipTests -Pfast`
- `releaser.maven.publish-docs-commands` - Command to be executed to deploy a built project. If present `{{version}}` will be replaced by the proper version.
Defaults to the standard Spring Cloud wget and execution of ghpages.
- `releaser.maven.wait-time-in-minutes` - Max wait time in minutes for the process to finish. Defaults to `20`
- `releaser.pom.branch` - Which branch of Spring Cloud Release should be checked out. Defaults to "master",
- `releaser.pom.ignored-pom-regex` - List of regular expressions of ignored poms. Defaults to test projects and samples.,
- `releaser.working-dir` - By default Releaser assumes running the program from the current working directory.

TIP: You can pass the options either via system properties or via application arguments.
Example for system properties: `java -Dreleaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6 -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar`
Example for application argumemts: `java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6`

=== Examples

==== Keeping configuration in the project

If your project has some custom configuration (e.g. Spring Cloud Contract needs a script to be executed
to build the project and properly merge the docs) then you can put a file named e.g. `releaser.yml` under `config`
folder and run your application like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir -p target
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/cloud/internal/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar -O target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --spring.config.name=releaser
----

==== Specifying A Branch

By deafult the releaser will default to using the `master` branch of `spring-cloud-release`.
If you would like to use another branch you can specify it using the `releaser.pom.branch` property.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar target/spring-cloud-release-tools-spring-1.0.0.M1.jar --releaser.pom.branch=Camden.SR6

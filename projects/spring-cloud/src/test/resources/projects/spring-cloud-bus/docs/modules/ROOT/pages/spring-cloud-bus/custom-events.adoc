== Broadcasting Your Own Events

The Bus can carry any event of type `RemoteApplicationEvent`. The default transport is
JSON, and the deserializer needs to know which types are going to be used ahead of time.
To register a new type, you must put it in a subpackage of
`org.springframework.cloud.bus.event`.

To customise the event name, you can use `@JsonTypeName` on your custom class or rely on
the default strategy, which is to use the simple name of the class.

NOTE: Both the producer and the consumer need access to the class definition.

=== Registering events in custom packages

If you cannot or do not want to use a subpackage of `org.springframework.cloud.bus.event`
for your custom events, you must specify which packages to scan for events of type
`RemoteApplicationEvent` by using the `@RemoteApplicationEventScan` annotation. Packages
specified with `@RemoteApplicationEventScan` include subpackages.

For example, consider the following custom event, called `MyEvent`:

[source,java]
----
package com.acme;

public class MyEvent extends RemoteApplicationEvent {
    ...
}
----

You can register that event with the deserializer in the following way:

[source,java]
----
package com.acme;

@Configuration
@RemoteApplicationEventScan
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}
----

Without specifying a value, the package of the class where `@RemoteApplicationEventScan`
is used is registered. In this example, `com.acme` is registered by using the package of
`BusConfiguration`.

You can also explicitly specify the packages to scan by using the `value`, `basePackages`
or `basePackageClasses` properties on `@RemoteApplicationEventScan`, as shown in the
following example:

[source,java]
----
package com.acme;

@Configuration
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan({"com.acme", "foo.bar"})
//@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackages = {"com.acme", "foo.bar", "fizz.buzz"})
@RemoteApplicationEventScan(basePackageClasses = BusConfiguration.class)
public class BusConfiguration {
    ...
}
----

All of the preceding examples of `@RemoteApplicationEventScan` are equivalent, in that the
`com.acme` package is registered by explicitly specifying the packages on
`@RemoteApplicationEventScan`.

NOTE: You can specify multiple base packages to scan.

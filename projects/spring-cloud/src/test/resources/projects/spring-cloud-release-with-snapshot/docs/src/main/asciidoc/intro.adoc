Spring Cloud Release Train is a curated set of dependencies across a range of Spring Cloud projects.
You consume it by using the spring-cloud-dependencies POM to manage dependencies in Maven or Gradle.
The release trains have names, not versions, to avoid confusion with the sub-projects.
The names are an alphabetic sequence (so you can sort them chronologically) with names of London Tube stations ("Angel" is the first release, "Brixton" is the second).

==== Adding Project Lombok Agent

Spring Cloud uses http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html[Project Lombok]
to generate getters and setters etc. Compiling from the command line this
shouldn't cause any problems, but in an IDE you need to add an agent
to the JVM. Full instructions can be found in the Lombok website. The
sign that you need to do this is a lot of compiler errors to do with
missing methods and fields, e.g.

[indent=0]

==== Importing into Intellij
Spring Cloud projects use annotation processing, particularly Lombok, which requires configuration
or you will encounter compile problems. It also needs a specific version of maven and a profile
enabled. Intellij 14.1+ requires some configuration to ensure these are setup properly.

 1. Click Preferences, Plugins. *Ensure Lombok is installed*
 2. Click New, Project from Existing Sources, choose your spring-cloud project directory
 3. Choose Maven, and select Environment Settings. *Ensure you are using Maven 3.3.3*
 4. In the next screen, *Select the profile `spring`* click Next until Finish.
 5. Click Preferences, "Build, Execution, Deployment", Compiler, Annotation Processors. *Click Enable Annotation Processing*
 6. Click Build, Rebuild Project, and you are ready to go!

==== Importing into other IDEs
Maven is well supported by most Java IDEs. Refer to you vendor documentation.
